This repository contains a document that references all the (program
logic) EasyCrypt tactics. The idea is to add unit tests for all of
them (as a primitive form of documentation), and then to actually
document them (either by taking the already existing documentation
from the reference manual or by writing one from scratch).

I make this document public right now as it is already informative and
will contain more and more information as time goes on.
